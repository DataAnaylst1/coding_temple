This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
# Install packages and activating library

install.packages('tidyverse')
library(tidyverse)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
# Reading in CSV File

df <- read_csv('/Users/investmentguy/Documents/python_stuff/coding_temple/week6/day3/Call of Duty Reviews.csv')
```

```{r}
View(df)
```

```{r}
# Null and Alternative Hypothesis

Ho, game_title Black Ops II, leads in metascore, critic & user compound
Ha, does not lead in metascore, nor critic & user compound
```

```{r}
# Replaced Spaces in Columns with underscores and converted all to lowercase

names(df) <- gsub(" ","_", tolower(names(df)))

df
```

```{r}
# Checking for Null Values
colSums(is.na(df))
```

```{r}
# Dropping NA Values for metascore

df <- df %>% drop_na(metascore)

```

```{r}
#Confirming Current Null Values

colSums(is.na(df))
```

```{r}
# Dropping Null Values for critic_compound_score

df <- df %>% drop_na(critic_compound_score)
```

```{r}
# Confirming Current Null Value Count
# I will keep the NUll Values for platform and release_year, for my hypothesis testing is not concerned with these details, only the scores for each title
colSums(is.na(df))
```

```{r}
#table(df['game_title'])

# Mutate new column with critc and user compound and times by 100 to create simplicity when running analysis with metascore

df_mutate <- mutate(df,
                    user_and_critic_compound_score = round((critic_compound_score * user_compound_score)*100))
df <- df_mutate
df
```

```{r}
install.packages('plyr')
library(plyr)
```

```{r}

```

```{r}
ddply(df,"game_title", numcolwise(sum))
```

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x=game_title,y=metascore))+ geom_bar(stat = 'identity')
```

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x=game_title, fill=metascore)) + geom_bar(position='dodge')
```
