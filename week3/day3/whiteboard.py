# Move the first letter of each word to the end of it, then add "ay" to the end of the word. Leave punctuation marks untouched.
# Examples
# pig_it('Pig latin is cool') -> igPay atinlay siay oolcay
# pig_it('Hello world !')    -> elloHay orldway !

# Understand
# I need to grab the first of each word and place it at the end and add 'ay' at the end of it
#Plan
# I could look to do an iteration of each word and then append ay at the end
#for loop for
